          Hi! My name is Anastasia Nathanailidou, and I'm a full-stack web developer who loves to create unique designs.
          When working on any project, I always strive for a high-quality outcome. I'm an outside-the-box thinker,
          who's driven by curiosity, and willing to learn new software or programming languages. As an educated 3D Game Artist,
          I'm passionate about designing creative and engaging visual experiences.<br/><br/>
          A lot has changed in the past few years, so I decided to switch to web development which has interested me for
          a long time. Now I want to utilize my skills to design and code functional websites that stand out.
